# CP468-Simple-Genetic-Algorithm-and-Applications
This project implements a Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) for optimization using predefined and custom objective functions. Features include adjustable parameters, fitness visualization, and a Tkinter GUI for easy function selection. It evaluates performance on benchmark functions like Sphere, Rosenbrock, and Himmelblau, plus two custom functions.
